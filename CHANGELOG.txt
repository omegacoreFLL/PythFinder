Change Log
==========


0.0.1 (30/03/2024)
------------------
- First 'official' release of the EV3 enhanced hardware code (current 'pythfinder-quick-start').
- It includes: 
    * on-brick button managing;
    * a robot run handler;
    * led control;
    * robot localisation;
    * pure feedback-approach for pathing;
    * PID controller;
    * edge detector;

NOTE: This release is not part of the library, it's external code for EV3 robots,
      for it's usage it needs to be copied in the robot code folder


0.0.2 (UNRELEASED)
------------------
- Creating a separate simulator project, used for visualising robot's motion.
- Downsides:
    * limited use, can't directly influence robot's real life motion;
    * needs the the same code from the robot's project to be translated 
      (micropython to python and vice versa);
    * very limited user-friendly interface interraction;
    * hardcoded > abstraction;


0.0.3.17 (17.05.2024)
---------------------
- First easy-use version out of all.
- Small unusable versions were needed for packaging all the data right.
- Improvements:
    * adding feedforward approach through complex trajectory building techniques,
      with velocity-constrained motion profiles, assuring continuity, for more 
      precise applications;
    * markers, interrupters and volatile constraints, which are more or less
      modifiers for the trajectory's behaviour. Markers enable you to perform
      multithreading-related tasks inside the trajectory;
    * in-game menu for easier manipulation of constants (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED)
    * migrating to more complex abstraction for elements such as the menu or the
      actual robot 
    * PS4 and PS5 controllers are now supported, but not any Nintendo device
    * visualisaltion of the velocity and acceleration profiles using matlib


0.0.3.19 (17.05.2024)
---------------------
- you can take screenshots now! (press on the left joystick button and find them
  in the 'Screenshots' folder where the library is installed)
- easter egg?
- fixed more visual bugs 
- fixed 0.0.3.18 (buttons weren't accessible)

0.0.3.21 (23.05.2024)
---------------------
- fixed typos
- updated README.md 
- fixed little errors

0.0.4.0 (01.07.2024)
---------------------
- added more kinematics (Tank, H-Drive, Mecanum, Kiwi, X-Drive, Swerve)
- added the option to change the turning center of the robot
- now you can move the robot on the field with the mouse
- customizable velocity graph
- now the trail does resize with the window
- compleate rework of the trajectory system
- added presets (default presets include FTC and FLL fields), customizable by the user
- fixed display bugs in the menu
- now the simulation window is resizable

0.0.4.1 (04.07.2024)
---------------------
- fixed trajectory generation bugs

0.0.4.2 (07.07.2024)
---------------------
- now you need to click ON the robot to move it with the mouse
- acceleration graph ends correctly on the X axis
- no more acceleration spikes when interrupting a motion segment
  (they are supposed to but it limits the user view of the graph)
- changed FLL robot rotation center to match our robot exactly
- trail doesn't freeze anymore when changing presets
- coordinates resize acording to the screen 
- now the autonomus mode applies correctly
